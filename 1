1) counting the number of squares on chessboard

HOW TO SOLVE?
no. of squares on each side =8;
no of squares of size unit size = 8*8 =64;
no of squares of size 2*unit size = (8-1)*(8-1) = 49
no of squares of size 3*unit size = (8-2)*(8-2) = 36
no of squares of size 4*unit size = 25
no of squares of size 5*unit size = 16
no of squares of size 6*unit size = 9
no of squares of size 7*unit size = 4
no of squares of size 8*unit size = 1
i.e. TOTAL = 64+ 49+ 36+ 25 +16 +9 +4 + 1 =204
i.e. no. of squares on a hypothetical chess-board having n boxes each side = Î£n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
in this case of 8x8 chessboard;

total number of squares = 8*9*17/6=204

2) There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. You can conduct a race among at most 5. Find out the minimum no. of races that are required to get the top 3 horses.

one might think that 5 race amoung 5 horses each and then a race among the previously winning horses will give us the top 3
but imagine a scenario in which the horse in race-2 that came second has speed higher than the horese that came fiirst in race-1 this will lead to erroneous result

So then 
we organize 5 races first ---> select top 3 from each race (5*3=15 selected)
3 more races of 5 horse each ---> again select top 3 horses (3*3=9 selected)
2 more races of 4 and 5 horses ----> select top 3  (2*3=6 selected)
2 more races
total of 12 races to get the top 3

but we can do better
HOW?
-----------------------------------------------------
ROUND 1 ( 5 races of random sets (A,B,C,D,E) (size=5) of horses ) ---> (5 races)
for next round 
set 1(say) -> round 1 winners of each set

ROUND 2 ( 1 race of  set 1 horses i.e winners of ROUND 1) --->(1 race)
the horse that wins this race is the fastes
the horses that fail to make into top 3 are removed out of the race so are their round one sets (since the horses in those sets are slower that these horses => slower then round 2 top 3)
now we are lest with 
horse #11 h12 h13 h14 h15
horse #21 h22 h23 h24 h25
horse #31 h32 h33 h34 h35

horses acc. spees acc. round 2 and their round 1 sets

ROUND-3
h#11 is fastest
for second spot -> h21 h12 h13 compete
for third spot -> h31 h22  compete
 therefore 1 more race for second spot and third spot 
 
 total no of races = 5+1+1
